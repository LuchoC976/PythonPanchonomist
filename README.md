This repository is the code that I used while giving a course to the economics' club of my university

Hello everyone, this repository includes all of the Python scripts I used to teach about Python and a brief segment of data analysis to the members
of the economics' club of my university (Universidad San Francisco de Quito). There are only .py files in this repository with one exception, which
is a .csv file that I used to demonstrate the use of the Pnadas library for data analysis
